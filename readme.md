Determines the background and foreground color of the terminal
using the `OSC 10` and `OSC 11` terminal sequence.
On Windows, the colors are queried using the Win32 Console API.

This is useful for answering the question *"Is this terminal dark or light?"*.

## Example
```rust,no_run
use terminal_colorsaurus::{color_scheme, QueryOptions};

let colors = color_scheme(QueryOptions::default()).unwrap();
dbg!(colors.is_dark_on_light());
```

## Wishlist
These are some features that I would like to include in this crate,
but have not yet had the time to implement. PRs are welcome :)

* [ ] A CLI tool version of this library.
* [ ] Improve dynamic latency strategy (iTerm is a bit of a headache here as it has quite a big range when it comes to latency).
* [ ] Add support for `$COLORFGBG`
     (I don't  know if this is a good idea actually, the [readme](https://github.com/Canop/terminal-light#colorfgbg-strategy) of `terminal-light` lists some downsides.)

## Inspiration
This crate borrows ideas from many other projects. This list is by no means exhaustive.

* [xterm-query]: Use `mio` to wait for the terminal's response with a timeout.
* [termbg]: Lists a lot of terminals which served as a good starting point for me to test terminals as well.
* [macOS doesn't like polling /dev/tty][macos-dev-tty] by Nathan Craddock
* [This excellent answer on Stack Overflow][perceived-lightness] for determining the perceived lightness of a color.
